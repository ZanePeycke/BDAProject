Our primary goal is to accurately predict stock price based on historical price and Twitter sentiment. 
Our approach is different than previous results we are aware of because of the scope and scale of our sentiment analysis. 
We gathered an entire year of tweets and independently tested four sentiment analysis tools. 
This means our model is more accurate than the results we are aware of and has a higher potential
to generalize to real-time and long-distance price forecasting.
